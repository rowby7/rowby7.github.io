            <p>Hi! I'm Rowby, a senior Computer Science student at Lehman College with a passion for building clean, functional websites and solving real-world problems through code. Over the past few years, I've worked on projects ranging from mobile apps to full-stack web apps, and Iâ€™ve loved learning how to build them.</p>
           
            <p>I am especially interested in being Software Engineer. Some of my focuses are full-stack Mobile app development and full-stack web development. Outside of class I have participated in a Hackathon where I led a team of four in a 3-day hackathon creating a full functioning website</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing video games or at a movie theater watching the latest blockbuster</p>
